# Metals & Mining - Natural Language Processing Dashboard

> utils.config and utils.db_toolbox functions <b><u>are not</u></b> provided!

> Proto-type, unoptimised and computationally heavy.

Todo:
 1. Create classes, reduce repeated code.
 2. Optimise SpaCy NLP functions and querying (pre-load data?).
 3. Data exploratory analysis on topic, term, n-gram, geotags and named entity recognition (NER) correlations with price.
 4. Equity analysis for company share price correlation with natural language processing (NLP) variables.

Built for a data visualisation web application using Python, SpaCy natural language processing and Plotly Dash.

### Timeseries analysis

Identifying correlation between price, sentiment and frequency for various metals.
